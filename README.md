**Flashy App**

This app takes a .csv file as input and creates random flash cards from the data. It will display an item to be reviewed
for 3 seconds, and then flip the flash card to show the definition.

<ul>
<li>If the red X button is clicked, the current item will remain in the pool of items.</li>
<li>Each time the green check button is clicked (representing an item that has been successfully learned), the current 
item will be removed from the pool of items, and a new .csv containing the reduced pool of items will be created.
</li>
</ul>

For demonstration purposes, a list of 101 common French words is included. Any data set in .csv format can be used, 
provided it is a two-column table of items and their definitions, with headers in the first row.
